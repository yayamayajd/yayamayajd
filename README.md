## Hi there 👋

## About Me 😄

Hi, I'm Jiadai! I’m the kind of person who keeps asking “why.” I don’t just want to use tools — I want to understand how they work together, how the pieces connect, and how I can apply that knowledge to build something real.
I tend to learn fast — but more importantly, I test what I learn. I like to take an idea, turn it into a small project, and see what actually works. If it breaks, I fix it. If it’s unclear, I write it down. That loop of try → fail → reflect is how I grow.



- 🌱 I’m currently exploring **DevOos** and **automation**.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects** and **innovative web applications**.
- 💬 Ask me about **Python**, **CI/CD**, and **Kubernetes**.

## 🔹 What I’ve been working on
I started developing a fruit management system with Flask and PostgreSQL to explore CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and Kubernetes deployment (K3s).
I also worked on automating AWS infrastructure using OpenTofu and Ansible — defining EC2 instances as code and writing playbooks to configure the environment from scratch.
My background in writing and storytelling helps me think in structure, connect details with purpose, and communicate clearly — whether it’s code, config, or documentation.
